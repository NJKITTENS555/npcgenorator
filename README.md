This program is meant to generate non-playable characters (NPCs) and their skills and characteristics. These attributes will be generated at random. There are 5 different attributes. There is health (what hp they have left), speed, living or dead, clumsy, and stamina along with around 10 different names. So if you don't like the stats just run the code again.
 Here is how it runs:
 
 For each of the names on the list it does the following:
 generates a random number between 1 and 100 for the Npcs health. Higher the number, higher the health. Health is out of 100.
 
 If the number is 0 then the status of the npc is dead. Otherwise the NPC is alive.

 For stamina it generates a random number between 1 and 10. That number has 1 subtracted from it then added to it. Higher the number, higher the stamina.

 To decide if the npc is clumsy it generates a number that is 1 or 2. If the number is 2 then the npc is clumsy, otherwise the npc is not clumsy. 

For speed a random number is generated between 1 and 100 and that is the speed. 100 is the fastest and 1 is the slowest
It repeats this process for all the names on the list, so that each one has unique stats.

I made this program very simple and easy to understand. If you have any questions don’t be afraid to ask questions. 
If you have any issues I will be very happy to fix them. Don’t be afraid to let me know if there is anything you want me to add.
